# image_similarity

### Installation 
It is possible to install the repository from Github:

git clone https://github.com/giulst/image_similarity/

The repository contains:
- data: a folder with data image that can be used to train and to test the pipeline
- Image_similarity_pipeline.ipynb: a jupyter notebook with the image similarity pipeline.
- Image_similarity_pipeline.html: the html from the notebook, with some examples already saved and displayed
- requirements.txt: file that contains the packages used to build and run the pipeline.

### Idea
The idea behind the pipeline is divided in three main step:
## 1. Extract from each figure some important features that can be used to define similarity between shapes.
Among them, the color of the shape and of the background, the center of gravity of the feature which determines the position, the dimension of the shape.
To obtain the colors, I simply
